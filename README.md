I have worked and contributed in many projects before with my friend [SudhanPlayz](https://github.com/SudhanPlayz) (Fun fact, I was introduced to the world of coding by him).

I work with various techologies which includes Javascript/Typescript, API Development, Backend. I use MongoDB, MySQL, Express or Fastify for backend applications. 

Additionally, I have experience with Discord bot development, Blockchain, a little experience with Web3, and DApps and I'm always trying to stay updated with new technologies.
